# Sketch 360: a Microsoft Garage Project
A Cross Platform 360 Degree Panoramic Sketching App

- Install from the [Google Play Marketplace](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.garage.sketch360app)
- Install from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/sketch-360/9p89s2qlh11t)

Sketch 360 was built by [Michael Scherotter](https://github.com/mscherotter) and 
[originally released](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/blog/2018/11/finally-a-way-to-sketch-360-degree-vr-scenes/) 
as a Microsoft Garage project in 2018 as a UWP app for Microsoft Windows and is available today for free in the
[Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/sketch-360/9p89s2qlh11t).  This is a new version of Sketch 
360 built to take advantage of pen-enabled devices that have two screens like the 
[Microsoft Surface Duo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-duo) but it should work on most 
Android devices as well.
