# Sketch 360 a Microsoft Garage Project
A Cross Platform 360 Degree Panoramic Sketching App

Sketch 360 was built by [Michael Scherotter](https://github.com/mscherotter) and [originally released](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/blog/2018/11/finally-a-way-to-sketch-360-degree-vr-scenes/) as a Microsoft Garage project in 2018 as a UWP app for Microsoft Windows as is available today for free in the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/sketch-360/9p89s2qlh11t).  This is a new version of Sketch 360 built to take advantage of pen-enabled devices that have two screens like the [Microsoft Surface Duo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-duo) but it should work on most Android devices as well.
